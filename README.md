## Development

In order to run this app locally, please install the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli).

First, ensure that your packages are up to date and installed:

```bash
yarn
```

Then login to Firebase:

```bash
yarn login
```

To run a local test of the React App with hot reloading:

```bash
yarn start
```

To run a full integration test with all the Cloud Functions and Firebase packages enabled:

```bash
yarn int
```

### Cloud Functions

Due to the _(kind of annoying)_ fact that Google Cloud Platform [only supports older versions of Node](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/manage-functions) you will need to use Node 10 to build and deploy the Cloud Functions side of this project. _CircleCI is already set up for this_

Consider using the Node Version Manager: [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to make this all a lot easier.

This project specifically uses Node Version `node:10.16.3` for its build and cloud functions.

Also, remember to set up your [Local Emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/local-emulator) properly with:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/key.json"
```

Local Host URL for a given function will be at: `localhost:5000/qlab-cc/asia-northeast1/didUserQuizYesterday`
